# ConEx
A combined framework for content extraction

This is a repo to archive the python code used in my thesis.

Most ipython notebook files are used for testing except "eval.ipynb", which is used to run the experiments in the thesis.

* BTE.py (Body Text Extraction)
* CCB.py (Content Code Blurring)
* CETD.py (Content Extraction via Text Density)
* CETR.py (Content Extraction via Text Ratio)
* CTTD.py (Compound Text-Tag Difference)

* ConEx_dom.py (Combine dom-based algorithms)
* ConEx_line.py (Combine line-based algorithms)
* ConEx_token.py (Combine token-based algorithms)
* ConEx.py (Combined above three parts)

* process.py (Code for preprocessing and evaluation)
* convert_XXX.py (Process XXX dataset)
* kmeans.py (Customed kmeans algorithm for CETR-2D)
